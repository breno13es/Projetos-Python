Soooo, this is a bit of a Note to myself and others, if you want my services (When i get gud ofc) feel free, ill probably answer in the morning or night.

This is my (actual) main file of projects, and pretty much everything on my applience, im planning to be a back-end Dev in this start, and maybe in a not so after future a full-stack Devww

feel free to see and send suggestions on how to make the code more usable or short or whatever changes would help me as a Dev

i separate those into 3 classes the Easy/Medium/Hard, and im already starting at some point, im making a lot of logical thinking problems in Python, and its helping, its honestly the best part of my day.

Thx so much for reading this and enjoy the projects of a begineer in Python. :)
